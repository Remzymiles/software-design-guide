# SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE

THE SUMMARY OF THE PDF ON SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE BY ARJAN CODES AS REQUESTED FROM OsMaxin Developers

Software design can be simply defined as the systematic planning of a software system, defining its design, components and structure so as to meet a specific user friendly requirement. it is a very essential part of software development because it entails the plans of the software, Do's and Don't's and overall design of the software so as to meet the desired requirement.

Below are a few key points to follow when planning your software;

ABOUT : Firstly you have to understand what the software does and who it is made for, this gives you an in-depth definition of your software because you understand what and who the software is made for and how it should work. it also helps you understand and know how to go about your software, things to avoid when building your software, issues that may or may not arise when building your software and possibly how to go about the issues when they arise or prevent the issues from arising at all.

USER INTERFACE : The next step is defining the structure of the user interface. A user interface should always be user friendly. Thinking as a user is very essential in this step. Your user interface should be very easy to use by the user and also very understandable by the user whilst also being good looking enough to keep the users attention in check.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION : The third step is the technical specification of the software. Here you determine whether you have to use a specific language or library for your software. Determine whether there will be required functionalities, components or materials for your software and so on...

TESTING AND SECURITY : Testing helps you determine the durability of your code, helps to find errors or bugs and also find unused or unnecessary codes. A testers mindset is one thing required to write good codes, it helps you avoid writing unnecessary codes or codes that might conflict with each other at some point. With a testers mindset your codes becomes almost automatically organized and readable.

DEPLOYMENT : For a seamless deployment, you should look at your software and think whether there are any changes to be made like the incorporation of microservices or the writing of migration scripts. These and more should be done to avoid deployment issues.

PLANNING : Planning is basically thinking about things that may go wrong, features that are absolutely required for the software and optional features for the software, knowing the time required for developing the software or each component for the software, the cost of developing the software, the risk factors while developing the software and alternative routes to follow to  avoid them.

BROADER CONTEXT : This is the seventh and final step. Here you identify the current limitations of the software, possible extensions or features that can be added to the software in the future, and generally any other considerations. It is advised that you keep an open mindset here, you think of the things your software can do now, what is should be able to do at some point in the future, features that can or should be added at some point in the future and so much more.
